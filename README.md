# <span style="color:deepskyblue"> Real-time Papaya Ripeness Detection with YOLOv8 & Streamlit </span>

This repository is an extensive open-source project showcasing the seamless integration of **object detection** using **YOLOv8** (object detection algorithm), along with **Streamlit** (a popular Python web application framework for creating interactive web apps). The project offers a user-friendly and customizable interface designed to detect and track objects in real-time video streams from sources such as webcam, static videos and images.


## <span style="color:deepskyblue">WebApp Demo on Streamlit Server</span>

This app is up and running on Streamlit cloud server!!! You can check the demo of this web application on this link 
[Papaya-detection](https://papaya-detection.streamlit.app/)

## Installation

- Clone the repository: git clone <https://github.com/CodingMantras/yolov8-streamlit-detection-tracking.git>
- Change to the repository directory: `cd yolov8-streamlit-detection-tracking`
- Create `weights`, `videos`, and `images` directories inside the project.
- Download the pre-trained YOLOv8 weights from (<https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.pt>) and save them to the `weights` directory in the same project.

## Usage

- Run the app with the following command: `streamlit run main.py`
- The app should open in a new browser window.

### ML Model Config

- Select task (Detection, Segmentation)
- Select model confidence
- Use the slider to adjust the confidence threshold (25-100) for the model.

One the model config is done, select a source.

### Detection on images

- The default image with its objects-detected image is displayed on the main page.
- Select a source. (radio button selection `Image`).
- Upload an image by clicking on the "Browse files" button.
- Click the "Detect Objects" button to run the object detection algorithm on the uploaded image with the selected confidence threshold.
- The resulting image with objects detected will be displayed on the page. Click the "Download Image" button to download the image.("If save image to download" is selected)

## Detection in Videos

- Create a folder with name `videos` in the same directory
- Dump your videos in this folder
- In `settings.py` edit the following lines.

```python
# video
VIDEO_DIR = ROOT / 'videos' # After creating the videos folder

# Suppose you have four videos inside videos folder
# Edit the name of video_1, 2, 3, 4 (with the names of your video files) 
VIDEO_1_PATH = VIDEO_DIR / 'video_1.mp4' 
VIDEO_2_PATH = VIDEO_DIR / 'video_2.mp4'
VIDEO_3_PATH = VIDEO_DIR / 'video_3.mp4'

# Edit the same names here also.
VIDEOS_DICT = {
    'video_1': VIDEO_1_PATH,
    'video_2': VIDEO_2_PATH,
    'video_3': VIDEO_3_PATH,
}

# Your videos will start appearing inside streamlit webapp 'Choose a video'.
```

- Click on `Detect Video Objects` button and the selected task (detection/segmentation) will start on the selected video.
